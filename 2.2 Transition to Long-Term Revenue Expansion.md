### 2.2.1 Transition to a Tech-Focused Model

Transitioning to a tech-focused model represents a pivotal stage in Blueberry Inc.'s growth. This shift involves broadening the company's expertise from traditional marketing campaigns to the development and implementation of advanced technological solutions. The following steps outline how this transition will be executed:

#### Development of Proprietary Tools and Platforms

One of the primary objectives of this transition is to create proprietary software tools and platforms tailored to the unique needs of SMEs and larger enterprises. These solutions could range from customer relationship management (CRM) systems to analytics-driven marketing platforms. By offering customized tools, Blueberry Inc. positions itself as an indispensable partner, helping clients optimize their operations and marketing efforts.

#### Expansion of Service Offerings

The company will complement its existing marketing services with technology-based solutions such as web development, application design, and process automation. This expanded portfolio enables Blueberry Inc. to meet a broader range of client needs, creating additional revenue streams while strengthening client retention. Furthermore, the integration of marketing and technology solutions enhances the value proposition, as clients benefit from a unified strategy that bridges creative and operational gaps.

#### Talent Development and Recruitment

To support this transition, Blueberry Inc. plans to invest in talent acquisition and development. Hiring specialists in software engineering, data analytics, and user experience design ensures the company has the expertise to deliver high-quality technological solutions. Internally, existing team members will undergo training to adapt to the demands of tech-driven projects, fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation.

#### Operational and Financial Implications

Transitioning to a tech-focused model will require upfront investment in infrastructure, tools, and personnel. To mitigate financial risks, Blueberry Inc. will phase in these changes, beginning with pilot projects that demonstrate the viability and profitability of tech-based solutions. Initial success in these pilot projects will generate momentum, attract funding, and pave the way for larger-scale operations.

### 2.2.2 Diversification of Revenue Streams

Revenue diversification is a critical aspect of Blueberry Inc.'s long-term strategy. By reducing reliance on a single income source, the company ensures financial stability and resilience against market fluctuations. The following approaches will drive this diversification:

#### Expansion into Overseas Markets

Globalization offers immense potential for Blueberry Inc. to tap into high-value overseas markets. These markets, particularly in developed economies, often demand customized marketing and technology solutions that align with their specific business contexts. Blueberry Inc. will prioritize establishing a presence in regions such as North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific by leveraging partnerships, local expertise, and targeted outreach campaigns.

#### Licensing and Subscription Models

To complement project-based revenues, Blueberry Inc. will develop licensing and subscription models for its proprietary tools and platforms. This approach generates recurring income, creating financial predictability and enhancing the company's long-term viability. For instance, a subscription-based analytics tool could offer SMEs affordable access to insights that improve decision-making, while licensing agreements for larger enterprises could yield substantial one-time revenue.

#### Partnerships and Collaborations

Collaborating with established technology firms and marketing agencies enables Blueberry Inc. to access new client segments and share resources. Partnerships can range from co-developing software solutions to cross-promoting services, amplifying the company's reach and reputation. Additionally, forming strategic alliances with regional players in overseas markets helps Blueberry Inc. navigate local business environments effectively.

#### High-Margin Products and Services

As part of its diversification strategy, Blueberry Inc. will prioritize the development of high-margin products and services. Custom software solutions, for example, can command premium pricing due to their tailored nature and complexity. Similarly, long-term marketing and technology consulting retainers offer consistent income with significant profitability.
