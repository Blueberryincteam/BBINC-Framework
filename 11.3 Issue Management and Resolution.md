    - Classify issues by type (e.g., technical, operational, or client-related) and severity (e.g., low, medium, high).
    - Example: A critical system outage is categorized as high severity, while a minor typo on a report is low severity.
3. **Prioritization:**
    
    - Assign priority levels based on the impact and urgency of the issue.
    - Example: Resolve an error affecting a live client campaign before addressing internal feedback.

4. **Resolution Implementation:**
    
    - Execute the action plan and resolve the issue.
    - Example: Deploy a hotfix to address a bug causing website downtime.
5. **Validation and Feedback:**
    
    - Verify the effectiveness of the resolution and seek feedback from stakeholders.
    - Example: Test the fixed feature in staging before redeploying it live.
