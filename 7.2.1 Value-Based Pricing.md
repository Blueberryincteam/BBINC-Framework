Value-based pricing is a strategy where the cost of services or products is determined by the perceived value they deliver to the client rather than their production cost. This approach aligns with Blueberry Inc.'s commitment to delivering measurable outcomes and maximizing client satisfaction. By emphasizing results, value-based pricing builds trust and positions the company as a premium service provider in the marketing and tech industries.
