#### **2. Agile Execution**

1. **Sprint-Based Development:**
    
    - Divide the project into smaller, manageable sprints with specific goals for each iteration.
    - Example: Complete user interface designs in the first sprint and core backend development in the second.
2. **Regular Stand-Ups:**
    
    - Conduct daily or weekly stand-up meetings to track progress, address challenges, and realign priorities.
    - Tools: Use Slack or Microsoft Teams for virtual stand-ups.
3. **Client Feedback Integration:**
    
    - Incorporate client feedback at the end of each sprint to ensure alignment with expectations.
